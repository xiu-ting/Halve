Mentored by Mac Ling from Bucket Technologies, I wrote this article to draw attention to the falling coin donations to charities in Singapore. With feedback from charities we were working with, we sought to bring to light how coin donations were difficult and expensive for charities to manage and thus, increase the uptake on the function within the Bucket app to donation change to their selected charities. 

### Rerouting Singaporean Coins for a Good Cause

Singaporeans may remember this donation box cleverly shaped as a girl to collect donations for the Spastic Children's Association of Singapore (SCA). Often located at supermarkets, loose change would be passed to eager children to be placed in the box. Now, such donation boxes are rare.

One consideration for the reduction of these statue-boxes and even the plainer, smaller acrylic boxes at retailers is the sheer cost of collecting the coins. Not only is the physical coin pickup costly and cumbersome, but also as part of the Charities Act, charities must adhere to a strict audit process throughout the collection of cash donations. In light of these changes and taking into account the various financial and resourcing strains many charities are already under, are donation boxes then still worth the effort? According to Straits Times, even by 2013, charities like SCA were reporting that less than 0.5% of their total annual fundraising came from the island-wide donation boxes: compare this to a decade earlier, when that percentage had been between 1 to 1.5%.  Some, including Executive Director of SCA, Mr. Alfred Tan, venture that the movement towards cashless transactions is responsible for the donation boxes’ waning popularity.

So, is the cashless economy truly the culprit in the decline of donation box usage? It would appear not, according to a 2016 survey by KPMG which cites that a whopping 60% of all consumer retail transactions in Singapore are still conducted using cash. So where is all the cumbersome loose change going now?  Due to their inconvenience, coins end up forgotten or lost everywhere: in purses, cupboards, Milo tins and even trash cans. It’s reported that more than $85M SGD worth of coins end up in landfills every year.

Given these barriers to coin collection, charities are caught in a difficult place, stuck between physical coins and digital currency. Many, while struggling with decreasing cash donations, also contend with unaffordable or inaccessible online donation options, leaving few appealing options for receiving donations.

Bucket aims to bridge this gap by digitising coin change during retail transactions. When you make a purchase in cash, the cashier will return the notes due back to you and digitise the coin change directly into your Bucket account. When your account balance accumulates to $50, you can either make a donation to a charity of your choice via the Bucket application or transfer the money by GIRO into your normal bank account.

Launching in Singapore in late August 2018, Bucket aims to acts as an online solution to an age-old offline problem. Bucket is partnered with Singapore’s National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) - in particular Down’s Syndrome Association, Club Rainbow, and AIDHA as pilot charities to receive donations through the giving.sg interface. All charitable donations made to these charities are eligible for tax-deductible receipts.

In this transitional stage, charities must change their strategy in order to reclaim the loose change of Singaporeans.
