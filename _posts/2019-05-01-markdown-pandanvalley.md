My final project for the module Architecture & Society by Prof. Jane M. Jacobs. I conducted field research and observations, interviews and secondary research for this final paper. It was a good exercise in developing a strong individual narrative voice while communicating key historical, socio-economic and polictical elements that are surrounding the current concerns with the en bloc of Pandan Valley Housing Estate.
