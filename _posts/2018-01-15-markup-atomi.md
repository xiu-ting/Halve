atomi pte ltd. is a Singaporean-Japanese owned retail consultancy firm. While the front-facing store imports a curated range of exequisite furniture crafted in Japan, it also is home to a vibrant consultancy agency that provides a unique perspective because of their own experience in the retail industry. During my internship, I worked on two main projects- creating proposal decks for clients and creating their newly launched lifestyle magazine "360SSES" (read as 360 Bosses). In the latter project, I consulted with mulitple stakeholders within and external to the company to ensure the content was cohesive, meaningful and targeted the appropriate audience demographic.
