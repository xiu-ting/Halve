I conceived and designed this axonometric map of Yale-NUS College and its surrounding landscape under the mentorship of Prof. Joshua Comaroff. The design was selected to be printed as the Yale-NUS Urban Studies Tote for the Class of 2023. This design speaks to and tries to add new dimension to previous designs such as the figure ground print. The printing of the tote bag for the youngest cohort is a ritual in the Urban Studies faculty. I hope to work on more visuals designs for the Urban Studies faculty while I am a student.
