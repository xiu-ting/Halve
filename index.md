# About Me
urban x tech x design

I am a final year student at Yale-NUS College back from study abroad at Barnard College of Columbia University. I am taking classes in Urban Transformation and Leadership as well as CS. This summer I was at Dell Technologies as a User Experience (UX) Intern under the Experience Innovation Group. 

As an Urban Studies major with an Anthropology minor, my diverse interests have given me the opportunity to grow into a quick learning and highly adaptable individual that is self-driven. My experiences ranging from start-up to big tech are testament to my search for innovation in interconnected fields and my goal to bring unique perspectives to every question.

Besides that, I'm a film enthusiast (especially French New Wave), a ballroom dancer and a lover (and baker) of lemon
meringue pies. 

Please ping me for my resume!
