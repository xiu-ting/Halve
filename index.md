# About Me
urban x tech x design

I am a third year student at Yale-NUS College just back from study abroad at Barnard College of Columbia University. I am taking classes in Urban Transformation and Leadership as well as CS. This summer I wil be joining Dell Technologies as a User Experience (UX) Intern under the Experience Innovation Group. 

As an Urban Studies major with an Anthropology minor, I sought to find a word to describe my diverse interests and experiences. That word is innovation. Whether looking at diplomacy and public policy in the public sector, working at the frontier of FinTech at start-ups, or strategy management, I always seek innovation. To innovate does not always mean change, it sometimes can mean reinvigorating.

Besides that, I'm a film enthusiast (especially French New Wave), a ballroom dancer and a lover (and baker) of lemon
meringue pies. 

Please ping me for my resume!
