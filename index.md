# About Me

Hello! I am a third year student at Yale-NUS College currently on study abroad at Barnard College of Columbia University. I am an Urban Studies major with an Anthropology minor who seeks to be a innovative and analytical storyteller. Sometimes people tell me that seems..."contradictory"- I disagree and my work speaks for my effort to constantly refine my craft. 

Besides that, I'm a film enthusiast (especially French New Wave), a ballroom dancer and a lover (and baker) of lemon
meringue pies.
